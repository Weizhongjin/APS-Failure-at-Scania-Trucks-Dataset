## EE559 Final-Project APS Failure at Scania Trucks Dataset

### Project Information:

​	The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage.The system in focus on the “Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes.” [1]. This is a 2-class problem, and the goal is to predict the failure of components in the APS system, given various inputs. 



### Data:

Training and testing are posted on [D2L](https://courses.uscden.net/d2l/le/content/15346/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-251275); the training set labeled “SMALLER” has been down-sampled by factor of 3 (stratified), from the complete training set. The complete training set is also posted on D2L in case you choose to work with it also.* Please use the complete test set, as posted on D2L, for your test set. (There is no down-sampled version of the test set.)
